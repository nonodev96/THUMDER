          The current values of all registers are displayed in this window. It is possible to change the contents of the registers.

          The Register Menu

          There are several options in this menu to fix the type of representing the contents and the type of registers to be displayed:

          + Hexadecimal
          + Decimal
          + Display Special Registers
          + Display Integer Registers
          + Display Floatingpoint Registers
          + Display Doubleprecision-Floatingpoints
          + Display All Registers

          Change the contents of Registers

          You can change the contents of all GPRs, FPRs, the PC and the FPSR, but not the contents of the special (Hardware-)registers. You can select a register doubleclicking its name with the mouse. A dialog box is displayed, allowing you to change the content of the selected register. Legal values for integer registers are integer expressions and for floating point registers constant values.

          The DLX instructions loaded in the memory and their addresses are diplayed (hexadecimal and disassembled) in the Code window. Further, the set breakpoints for each instruction are marked with Bxx, where xx is the type of the breakpoint. If an instruction is currently executing in a pipeline stage, the characteristic colour of the stage is used as background colour for the instruction and it is also labled adequately.

          You can scroll up/down the memory using the arrows or the page keys. After executing one or more steps of a DLX code, the instructions executed at last are displayed.

          You can get detailed information about an instruction being in the pipeline or set /delete breakpoints selecting the instruction with the arrows or page keys and using the TAB-Key (You can also click the mouse button once). If you press the ENTER key (or doubleclicking the muse button), the Instruction-Information-Window is displayed. There are menu commands to set or delete breakpoints.

          The Code Menu:

          This menu contains the following commands:

          The Structure of the DLX-Pipeline will be displayed in this Child window. If the window is large enough, additional information about the instructions currently being executed in the pipeline will be displayed.

          Each stage is represented by different colours, characterizing this stage through all windows.

          After pressing TAB, you can select a stage with the arrow keys. Pressing ENTER (or doubleclicking the stage) allows you to get detailed information about the instruction in the stage via the Instruction-Information-Window.

          In this Child window is displayed, what is done in which cycle and in which stage. Each column represents the state of the pipeline in a given clock cycle. The current state of the pipeline (the last column) is underlayed with gray.

          You can select an instruction the same way as in the Code window and get more information about it via the Instruction-Information-Window.

          Furthermore, details about the stalls and executed forwardings (if enabled) are displayed:

          Stalls and Forwarding:

          Stalls are represented in boxes, that are underlayed with a colour corresponding to the stalled stage. The contents of the box give more information about the type of the stall:

          "R-Stall" - RAW-Stall. A dark red arrow shows (if enabled) the instruction that causes the stall.

          "T-Stall" - Trap-Stall. This stall occurs only by a Trap-Instruction . A Trap instruction remains in the IF-stage, until no other instructions are in the pipeline.

          "W-Stall" - WAW-Stalls. A dark red arrow shows (if enabled) the instruction that causes the stall.

          "S-Stall" - structural Stall, There are not enough resources to serving the instruction.

          "Stall" - If a Floatingpoint instruction is in MEM-stage, the next instruction will be stalled in the intEX-stage, labeled with "Stall".

          If "Display Forwarding" is enabled, forwarding is represented with a green arrow, showing the soucre and the destination of forwarding.

          See also Instruction execution for more details.

          The clock cycle diagram menu contains the following options:
